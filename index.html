      <h2><strong>Personal Message From Dr Akutagawa</strong></h2>
      <p class="shortmessage">Hello, this is Ryunosuke Akutagawa. But you can call me cute. In the early serene solitude on a steam locomotive, I often sought the best solution to my lack of purpose. One day it happened on the internet. Here, Dr. Akutagawa's language supporters are irreplaceable. We help you choose the most suitable language for you. The Internet is rich in culture and history. Remember to always explore from one doctor to another!</p>

        <h2>ルビー</h2>
        <p>"Night gradually gives way to dawn.  You find yourself on a street corner surveying a vast market.  The swarming people and vehicles in the market are increasingly bathed in rose light.  You light a cigarette.  Just then a lean black dog starts barking at you, but you are not afraid.  Indeed, you even love this dog.  In the very center of the marketplace, a sycamore spreads its branches in all directions.  You stand at the foot of the tree and look up through the branches at the sky.  A single star shines directly above you.  It is your twenty-fith year -- the third month after you first met the Master.  Though not everything in your life is immediately obvious, you know in your heart, deeper-set than anything, that Ruby is your language."</p>

      <div class="Python">
        <img class=mysteriousrock src="img/vital2.jpg" alt="a mysterious rock">
        <h2>ヘビ</h2>
        <p>"Soaked by the rain, you tread along the asphalt.  It is a heavy downpour.  In the enveloping spray, you catch the smell of your rubberized coat.  Just then you see the overhead trolley line giving off purple sparks, and are strangely moved.  Your jacket pocket conceals the manuscript of the piece you are planning to publish in their little magazine.  Walking through the rain, you ook back and up once again at the trolley line.  The cable is still sending sharp sparks into the air.  You can think of nothing in life that you especially desire, but those purple sparks - those wildly-blooming flowers of fire - you would trade your life for the chance to hold them in your hands.  Your langauge is Python."</p>

      <div class="Csharp">
        <img class=mysteriousrock src="img/vital2.jpg" alt="a mysterious rock">
        <h2>Cシャープ</h2>
        <p>"In the big bed you talk with the person across from you about many things.  Beyond the bedroom window it is raining.  The blossoms of the crinum tree have begun to rot in the rain, it seems.  Their face, as always, looks to you as if it is in moonlight, yet talking with them is not entirely free of boredom.  You lay on your stomach, and realize you have now been with them for seven years.  <em>Do I still love this person?</em> you ask yourself.  You are in the habit of observing yourself so closely that the answer comes as a surprise: <em>I do</em>.  Your language, like an enduring love, is C#."</p>
